Summary
This is a hash table designed with high performance, lock-free and memory-saving. Multiple threads can concurrently perform read/write/delete operations up to 10M ops/s in mordern computer platform. It supports up to 2^32 hash items with O(1) performance for both of successful and unsuccessful search from the hash table.
By giving max hash item number, atomic_hash calculates two load factors to match expected collision rate and creates array 1 with higer load factor, array 2 with lower load factor, and a small arry 3 to store collision items. memory pool for hash nodes (not for user data) is also designed for both of high performance and memory saving.

Usage
There are three atomic hash functions (atomic_hash_add/get/del). Generally they find target hash node, hold on it safely for a while to call hook function to read/copy/update/release user data:
typedef int (*hook)(void *hash_data, void *return_data)
here 'hash_data' will be copied from 'hash_node->data' (generally a pointer to the user data structure), and 'return_data' will be given by caller. The hook function must be non-blocking and spends time as less as possible, otherwise performance will drop remarkablly. The hook function should take care user data's memory if it returns -1(PLEASE_REMOVE_HASH_NODE), or simply returns either -2(PLEASE_SET_TTL_TO_DEFAULT) or a positive ttl number to indicate updating this node's expiration timer. actions for other return values are not defined. hook functions can be registered with your own hook functions after hash table is created, to replace the default ones that do not free any memory:
  h->on_ttl = default_func_remove_node;    -- return PLEASE_REMOVE_HASH_NODE
  h->on_del = default_func_remove_node;    -- return PLEASE_REMOVE_HASH_NODE
  h->on_add = default_func_not_change_ttl; -- return PLEASE_DO_NOT_CHANGE_TTL
  h->on_get = default_func_not_change_ttl; -- return PLEASE_DO_NOT_CHANGE_TTL
  h->on_dup = default_func_reset_ttl;      -- return PLEASE_SET_TTL_TO_DEFAULT
For more flexibility, below hash functions can use different hook functions in call-time:
atomic_hash_add(new_on_dup), atomic_hash_get(new_on_get), atomic_hash_del(new_on_del)

About TTL
TTL (in milliseconds) is designed to enable timer for hash nodes. Set 'reset_ttl' to 0 to disable this feature so that all hash items never expire. If reset_ttl is set to >0, you still can set 'init_ttl' to 0 to mark specified hash items that never expire.
reset_ttl: atomic_hash_create uses it to set hash_node->expire. each successful lookup by atomic_hash_add or atomic_hash_get may reset target item's hash_node->expire to (now + reset_ttl), per your on_dup / on_get hook functions;
init_ttlï¼šatomic_hash_add uses it to set hash_node->expire to (now + init_ttl). If init_ttl == 0, hash_node will never expires as it will NOT be reset by reset_ttl.
hash_node->expire: hash node's 'expire' field. If expire == 0, this hash node will never expire; If expire > 0, this hash node will become expired when current time is larger than expire, but no removal action immediately applies on it. However, since it's expired, it may be removed by any of hash add/get/del calls that traverses it (in another words, no active cleanup thread to clear expired item). So your must free user data's memory in your own hash_handle->on_ttl hook function!!!
