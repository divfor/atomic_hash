# Summary
atomic hash is a lock-free hash table designed for multiple threads to share a cache or data structure. It allows multiple threads to concurrent read/write/delete hash items without locks. 5M~20M ops/s can be performed in morden computer platform.

By giving max hash item number and expected collision rate, atomic_hash calculates two load factors and creates array 1 with higer load factor, array 2 with lower load factor, and a small arry 3 to store collision items. memory pool for hash nodes (not for user data) is also designed for both of high performance and memory saving. Both of successful and unsuccessful search from the hash table are O(1)

# Usage
Define your callback funtions to access hash data in non-blocking mode

atomic_hash_add/get/del finds target bucket and holds on it for your callback functions to read/copy/release bucket data or update ref counter. your callback functions must be non-blocking and return as soon as possible, otherwise performance drops remarkablly.

typedef int (*callback)(void *bucket_data, void *callback_args)

DTOR_TRY_HIT when adding but find target exists, return/memcpy data or update ref counter in this callback

DTOR_TRY_ADD whey adding and find an empty bucket, attach data in this callback

DTOR_TRY_GET when looking up and find the target bucket, return/memcpy data or update ref counter in this callback

DTOR_TRY_DEL when deleting and find target bucket, remove/release data in this callback

DTOR_EXPIRED when detecting an expired bucket, remove/release data in this callback

callback dtor[] = {DTOR_TRY_HIT_func, DTOR_TRY_ADD_func, DTOR_TRY_GET_func, DTOR_TRY_DEL_func, DTOR_EXPIRED_func};

ph = atomic_hash_create (num_strings, TTL_ON_AUTO_RESET, dtor);

#About TTL (in ms) of Bucket Item
if ttl == 0, bucket item will never expire and does not call DTOR_EXPIRED callback function. if ttl > 0, bucket item will timeout after ttl, and this bucket item may be removed by any of hash add/get/del calls that sees it. So release your own data in your DTOR_EXPIRED callback function!!!

lookup_reset_ttl: each successful lookup by atomic_hash_add or atomic_hash_get will automatically reset bucket item's expire timer to (now + lookup_reset_ttl).

initial_ttlï¼šset bucket's expire time as now + ttl when adding bucket item to hash table. bucket's expire time will NOT be reset with lookup_reset_ttl if initial_ttl == 0.

#Installation

Step 1, build dynamic shared libatomic_hash.so: 

cd src && make clean && make


Step 2, copy libatomic_hash.so to /usr/lib64/ and atomic_hash.h to /usr/include/

make install


Step 3, include "atomic_hash.h" in your source file(s) and dynamic link atomic_hash lib to your program. see test/makefile example
